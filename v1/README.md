# ioport layer
Support for direct HW ioport functionality via exception handling.
Requires no special persmissions.
Useful for legacy hardware emulation, LPT stuff, etc.
Note: Compiled with GCC, msvc could work with a bit of tweaking, but 
it's easier to use mingw for the test cases, inline stuff, etc.
